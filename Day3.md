# Day 3 of WebDev Summer camp!

Today we are changing the size of our image ( or images! ) and adding more HTML tags to our website. Also, we will **inspect** our website to see the HTML we created.

### Open your website
- Make sure your flash drive is plugged in
- Open your File Explorer ( the yellow folder at the bottom corner ) 
- Find the **USB Drive** drive on the left side
- In your USB Drive, go into your website project folder
- Double click the `index.html` file
- In the web browser viewing your website **Right Click anywhere on the page** and then click **Inspect**. What do you see?

### Resizing images
Your super duper HTML code should look similar to this: 
```html
<h1>My Website Title</h1>
<img src="imagename.jpg" />
```

To resize your image, you can add `width` and `height` **attributes**.
- **Look at how I changed my image's width and height below**
```html
<h1>My Website Title</h1>
<img src="imagename.jpg" width="200" height="200" />
```

What would you add to your website? My favorite is the `<summary>` tag!
